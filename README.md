# Luhn Challenge

The Luhn algorithm is a method that credit cards and other identification numbers can use to distinguish valid numbers from invalid ones. It is meant to prevent users from making accidental errors.

By running a quick mathematical formula on the numbers of a card, you can quickly determine whether or not it passes the Luhn algorithm.

In this challenge exercise, I will implement a checksum algorithm which is used in the real world to verify credit card numbers.
